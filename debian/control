Description: GNU R package for 'hash digest' of R data structures
 Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash 
 digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256,  
 crc32, xxhash, murmurhash, and spookyhash algorithms) permitting easy
 comparison of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to
 create hash-based message authentication code.
 .
 Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for 
 cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely 
 tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
