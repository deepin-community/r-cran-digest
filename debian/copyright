This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-digest package of digest, an R
package providing 'hash digests' of (serialized) R objects. The digest
package was was written by Dirk Eddelbuettel, with contributions by
Antoine Lucas, Jarek Tuszynski, Henrik Bengtsson, Simon Urbanek, Mario
Frasca and Bryan Lewis.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> (who is
also the upstream author/maintainer).

The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
as well as from 
        http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/digest.html

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'digest' to
'r-cran-digest' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) Debian R
packages.

   Title: Create cryptographic hash digests of R objects
   Description: The digest package provides a function 'digest()' for the
           creation of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5,
           sha-1, sha-256 and crc32 algorithms) permitting easy comparison
           of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create
           hash-based message authentication code.
    .
    The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the SHA-1 and
           SHA-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2,
           and the crc32 algorithm is described in
           ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For
           md5, sha-1 and sha-256, this packages uses small standalone
           implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For
           crc32, code from the zlib library is used.
    .
    Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
           cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely
           tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
